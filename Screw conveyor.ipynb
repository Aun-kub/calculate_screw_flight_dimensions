The calculations use formulas derived from the geometry of the developed pattern, such as \\$L1 = \\sqrt{(\\pi \\times OuterDiameter)^2 + Pitch^2}\\$ and \\$R1 = (L1 \\times h) / (L1 - L2) - Thickness\\$.\n",

        "*   Key dimensions, including Outer Radius, Inner Radius, and Sweep Angle, were added as annotations to the plot, displaying their calculated values (e.g., Outer Radius: 249.41 mm, Inner Radius: 83.41 mm, Sweep Angle: 334.57° based on example inputs) for clarity.\n",
        "*   The capability to display the generated plot in a notebook environment (`plt.show()`) and save it as an image file (e.g., `screw_flight_pattern.png`) was confirmed.\n",

        "*   The core functionality for calculating and visualizing the developed screw conveyor flight pattern is complete. The next logical step is to refine the Streamlit application's user interface, add more robust input validation, and potentially include options for different units or material types.\n",

        "* A Python function `calculate_screw_flight_dimensions` was developed to compute the unfolded outer radius, inner radius, and sweep angle based on user inputs and standard formulas. This function includes validation to prevent non-positive inputs, inner diameter greater than or equal to outer diameter, negative material thickness, and issues that would lead to division by zero or non-positive calculated radii.\n",
        "* A Python function `generate_flight_pattern_data` was created to generate the geometric coordinates required to plot the unfolded screw conveyor flight pattern using the calculated dimensions.\n",
        "* The calculation and plotting logic were integrated into the Streamlit application, triggered when the \"Calculate\" button is clicked.\n",
        "* The application displays the calculated outer radius, inner radius, and sweep angle in degrees, formatted to two decimal places, upon successful calculation.\n",
        "* The application includes error handling to catch and display input validation errors and other unexpected errors gracefully.\n",
